# The Perform application toolkit

Perform is a collection of bundles for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) PHP framework to help you build high-quality websites and applications efficiently.

It's a middle ground between off-the-shelf systems that lack flexibility and completely bespoke projects that take too long to code.

Perform gives you a rapid development workflow to build amazing applications your users will love.
