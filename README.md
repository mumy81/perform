# The Perform application platform

[Perform](https://useperform.com) is a collection of bundles for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) PHP framework to help you build high-quality websites and applications efficiently.

It's a middle ground between off-the-shelf systems that lack flexibility and completely bespoke projects that take too long to code.

Perform gives you a rapid development workflow to build amazing applications your users will love.

## Documentation

## License

Perform is commercial software; you need to purchase a license to use it in production.

The code is free to use during development, but will only work in production with a valid license key.
