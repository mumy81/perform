# The Perform application platform

[Perform](https://useperform.com) is a collection of bundles for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) PHP framework to help you build high-quality websites and applications efficiently.

It's a middle ground between CMS systems that lack flexibility and completely bespoke systems that take too long to code.

Perform brings you a rapid development workflow, while simultaneously providing the best possible experience for your users.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [useperform.com](https://useperform.com/docs).

## License

Perform is commercial software; you need to purchase a license to use it in production.

The code is free to use during development, but will only work in production with a valid license key.
