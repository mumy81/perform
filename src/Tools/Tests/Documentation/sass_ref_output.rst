Sass Variable Reference
=======================

Here is a list of sass variables you can set in your admin themes.

.. note::

    Remember that bootstrap also defines many variables you can customise.
    Perform uses these variables throughout, so any changes you make to
    them will cascade across Perform styles too.
    Look for ``_variables.scss`` in the bootstrap source for the complete list.
