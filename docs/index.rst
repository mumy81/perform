Welcome to Perform's developer guide!
=====================================

Perform is a collection of tools to help you build high-quality
websites and applications efficiently.

It's designed to be a middle ground between CMS systems that lack flexibility and completely bespoke systems that take too long to code.

Do you hate trying to mash plugins together, tweak themes, and work around your CMS?
Wish you had the time to build something quality from scratch?
Perform is the tool for you.

Perform is built on the fantastic `Symfony <https://symfony.com>`_ PHP framework, as a collection of bundles.
Knowledge of PHP and Symfony will be useful, but isn't absolutely neccessary.

Just getting started?
Check the :doc:`requirements <start/requirements>`, then follow the :doc:`installation guide <start/install>`.
