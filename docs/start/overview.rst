What is Perform?
================

Perform is a collection of bundles for the `Symfony
<https://symfony.com>`_
PHP framework to help you build high-quality websites and
applications efficiently.

It's a middle ground between off-the-shelf systems that lack
flexibility and completely bespoke projects that take too long to
code.

The bundles can be grouped into a few categories:

* Foundation bundles such as the :doc:`../base-bundle/index` and :doc:`../user-bundle/index`, which are used in nearly every Perform application.
* Supporting bundles such as the :doc:`../media-bundle/index` and :doc:`../rich-content-bundle/index`, which add significant functionality to build on top of.
* Finally, dependent on this functionality are domain-specific bundles such as the :doc:`../page-editor-bundle/index`, :doc:`../blog-bundle/index`, :doc:`../analytics-bundle/index`, and :doc:`../contact-bundle/index`, designed to cater to a specific use case.

Together, these bundles can be combined to exactly match your
requirements, instead of using a single monolithic system that
attempts to cater for everything and brings needless complexity.

Perform gives you a rapid development workflow to build amazing
applications your users will love.
