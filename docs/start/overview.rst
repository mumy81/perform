What is Perform?
================

Perform is a collection of bundles for the `Symfony
<https://symfony.com>`_
PHP framework, to help you build high-quality websites and
applications efficiently.

It's designed to be a middle ground between CMS systems that lack flexibility and completely bespoke systems that take too long to code.

The bundles are grouped into a few categories. Some bundles are foundational,
such as the *BaseBundle* and *UserBundle*, and are used in nearly
every Perform application.
Others such as the *MediaBundle* and *RichContentBundle* add
significant functionality to use in your application.
Finally, dependent on this functionality are domain-specific bundles,
such as the *ContactBundle*, *BlogBundle*, *MediaPlayerBundle*,
*TwitterBundle*, etc, that are designed to cater to a specific use case.

Together, these bundles can be combined to exactly match your
requirements and workflow, instead of using a single monolithic system
that attempts to cater for everything and brings needless complexity.

Perform brings you a rapid, superior development workflow, while
simultaneously providing the best possible experience for your users.
