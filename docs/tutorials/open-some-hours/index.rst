Arkwight and Granville run a small shop.
Tired of managing their inventory manually with spreadsheets and bits of paper, they've decided to create a web app to track it all in a single place.

Our task is to create it.
We'll use the *Base*, *User*, *Media*, and *Notification* bundles to accomplish this, getting familiar with how to use them and what they're capable of.

.. note::

    This introductory tutorial is suitable for beginners with a basic level of PHP / Symfony knowledge.
    Don't worry if you're not too familiar with Symfony, as the process will be covered step by step.
