Hipster Bikes
=============

We've been tasked with creating a website for *Hipster Bikes*, the trendiest bike gallery in town.

The site needs to have:

* Information and pictures for a collection of bikes
* An admin area to add new bikes
* A contact form for visitors to sing their praise.

We can put this together in no time with Perform.

.. note::

   Make sure you run ``perform requirements`` before you begin.

   Revisit the :doc:`requirements guide <../start/requirements>` if you get any errors.
