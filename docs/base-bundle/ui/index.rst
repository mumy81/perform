User Interface
==============

Perform comes with a modern user interface to use in your
applications, built with Bootstrap 4 and VueJs.

It could be used as the foundation of your whole app, or just for certain pages, such as the admin area of a marketing website.

The interface looks great out of the box, is themeable, and can be
deeply customised to suit your needs.
