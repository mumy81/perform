Let's use Perform to create an application!

We've been tasked with creating a website for *Hipster Bikes*, the trendiest bike gallery in town.

The site needs to have:

* A catalogue of information and pictures for each bike
* An admin area to add new bikes
* A contact form for visitors to sing their praise.

We can put this together in no time with Perform.

.. note::

   Make sure you have :doc:`installed Perform <../start/install>` before you begin.
